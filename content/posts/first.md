For this first post I'll discuss why I chose to make this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) instead of other technologies.

My choice was guided by the following:
- Fast - get a score of 100 (or very close) on [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
- Stay away from PHP
- Easy management of SEO
- Fast to add new content
- Low complexity

WordPress sites can be notoriously slow, but for interest's sake I decided to check out the speed of a WordPress site using the newest version and a lightweight theme.
The [TWENTY TWENTY-ONE](https://wp-themes.com/twentytwentyone/) theme looked quite nice and lightweight. It got an okay [PageSpeed Insights score](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp-themes.com%2Ftwentytwentyone%2F). At the time of writing I got a mobile score of 92 and a desktop score of 99.

Not too bad, but it's just a basic blog site....

Previously I've used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but so far I'm liking Hugo.  I tried a few Hugo theme demo sites on PageSpeed Insights and they all got a score of 100. The asset minification and the fact that it's all statically generated contributes to its speed.

I'll see how it goes if I need to do more customising, but so far Hugo looks great.

At some point I also want to look into the feasibility of using Hugo for sites for clients that want to be able to add and modify content themselves. I know there are some nice markdown editors for github, or one can use github directly, but the layperson wants something like WordPress's interface.
