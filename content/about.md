I have a passion for mathematics, science, and software development. I completed a Master of Design specialising in AI at Kyushu University, Japan. This followed a BSc Computer Science and Honours degree from University of Pretoria, South Africa, both cum laude. I am fluent in Japanese. My interests include specialty coffee, game design, and a deep understanding of everything! 
- I thrive on challenging projects.

- Over 5 years work experience as an AI specialist for [H&M](https://docwize.com/), a global Information Technology Services company that has been operating since 1999, with clients across Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the United States.

Other interests include,
- Languages (native English and Afrikaans, fluent daily Japanese, some French)
- Climbing, cycling, ice skating
